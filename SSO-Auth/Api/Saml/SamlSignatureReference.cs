/// <summary>
/// The one rule for what a signature's <c>Reference/@URI</c> may be on an inbound SAML document: a
/// same-document shorthand pointer, <c>#id</c>, whose fragment is a well-formed XML <c>NCName</c> - which is
/// exactly what SAML 2.0 requires, since the <c>ID</c> attributes it points at are <c>xsd:ID</c> and therefore
/// NCNames by schema. Shared by the response and the logout validators so the two can never drift on the one
/// question that decides WHAT a signature covers (#1003).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The NCName constraint is deliberately enforced HERE rather than left to the platform. .NET's
/// <c>DefaultGetIdElement</c> applies its own NCName guard before resolving, but that guard is documented as
/// compatibility-switchable, and the resolution below it interpolates the fragment into an XPath predicate
/// (<c>//*[@Id="..."]</c>) without escaping it. On a host with that switch flipped, an attacker-chosen
/// fragment carrying a quote would be XPath injection inside reference resolution. Constraining the fragment
/// before it is ever handed over makes the rejection a property of this plugin instead of a property of the
/// host's compatibility configuration - the difference between owning the rule and renting it.
///
/// The divergence from the platform's own resolution is ONE-DIRECTIONAL, which is what makes this safe rather
/// than merely different. .NET's <c>Reference.CalculateHashValue</c> resolves through
/// <c>Utils.ExtractIdFromLocalUri</c>, which rewrites a fragment ONLY when it begins <c>xpointer(id(</c>
/// (matched case-insensitively, taking text to the first <c>)</c> and stripping either quote character). No
/// string that triggers that rewrite is an NCName, and no NCName triggers it - so there is no input for which
/// this rule resolves one element while the platform digests a different one. The two can disagree only by
/// this rule resolving NOTHING where the platform would resolve something, which is the fail-closed direction.
///
/// The accept set on a default host is UNCHANGED by this rule, which is the answer to the obvious objection:
/// non-conformant identity providers do exist - a digit-leading UUID as the <c>ID</c> is the classic case, and
/// is precisely why the leading-underscore convention exists across ADFS, Azure AD, Auth0, Keycloak and
/// Shibboleth. The schema argument alone would not answer that ticket, but the empirical one does:
/// <c>DefaultGetIdElement</c> ALREADY applies an NCName test before resolving (its own comment cites xml:id 1.0
/// §4), so a digit-leading or colon-bearing ID already resolved to null and was already rejected before this
/// rule existed. What changed is WHERE the rejection happens and that it no longer depends on the host's
/// compatibility configuration. Corroborated by measurement: removing the call below does not turn the
/// end-to-end tests red, which is only possible because the platform applies the same test underneath.
